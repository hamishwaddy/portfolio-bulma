        <p>I'm an experienced, motivated person who has recently retrained to follow my ambition of becoming a web/software developer. After a nearly 20 year teaching career I have jumped at the opportunity to switch from the education industry into the IT sector. While still relatively new to front-end web/software development I am prepared to work as hard as it takes to become skilled at what I do.
          <br><br>
          My recent training focussed heavily on software and web development, mobile app development (using Xamarin Forms) as well as general programming in both C# and JavaScript. I am interested in working in front-end development and have basic experience building products using both Angular and React and feel comfortable working with these technologies. Long term I would like to develop the skills required to be considered a 'full-stack' developer, being able to work alongside clients bringing their required digital solutions to life.
          <br><br>
          Born and bred in the South Island, I am a family guy who loves spending time with friends and family. As well as having a passion for things related to technology, I am also passionate about sports and travel. I have lived in Tauranga for the last decade and am committed to living here for the forseeable future.
